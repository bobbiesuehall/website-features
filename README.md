##Ize & Dan Comics
Adding the little details that make a website run smoothly

1. a comic (image) slider to scroll through a series of 2-6 comics
2. responsive design. At Smart-phone sizes, page header is removed, an additional "title" slide is added, and each comic takes up the entire height (in landscape orientation) of viewfinder.
3. add indicators in sql Database to flag comics as individual or series. If series, indicate which comics belong together.
4. navigation arrows to slide comics in a series left/right or to the next/previous comic down/up.
5. and more as I create this site.
